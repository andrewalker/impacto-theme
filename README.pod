=head1 ICTUM BOOTSWATCH THEME

This theme is heavily based on L<spacelab|http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/>.

=head2 Rationale

I created this so that I could have a customized version of Twitter Bootstrap,
using Font Awesome and maybe other tweakings (such as remove unnecessary js,
etc), and also customize the SpaceLab theme from @thomaspark. Currently, I only
increased the font size, and automated the build process, but there might be
other improvements over time.

=head2 Install

Like bootstrap, this theme requires: recess, connect, uglify.js, and jshint.

    $ npm install recess connect uglify-js jshint -g

Then, simply run make.

=head2 Disclaimer

This theme is created for a specific application, and may or may not suit your
needs. I probably won't make very generally useful code here. I'm making it
available in case it might help others.
